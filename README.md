Notes:

Start to finish took me around 7 hours. 

Since I am not building the navbar or footer I just added placeholder space.

Normally I would make a reusable component for the employee divs but since I am not making a database call to a list of employees and am just hardcoding the names/titles/images I created components for each. 

Used Raw CSS.

This repo has so few commits because I moved the app to a new repo before hosting on Heroku.

Created an extremely basic backend with Express.js to host this on Heroku.
